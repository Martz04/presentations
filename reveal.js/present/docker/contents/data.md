## Understanding Docker
A Docker container is a `box`: it has its own machine name and IP address.
it also has its own `disk drive` created by Docker.

Many containers can be run in parallel inside one computer without knowing one another

    docker container run IMAGE

## Pro Tip
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
Containers are running `only` while the application inside the container is running.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
Containers in the exited state still exist, which means you can start them again, check the logs, and copy files to and from the containerâ€™s filesystem

## Web ping example
A `Docker image` is logically one thing--you can think of it as a big zip file that contains the whole application stack.

    docker image pull diamol/ch03-web-ping

A Docker image is physically stored as lots of small files, called image layers and Docker assembles them together to create the containers filesystem.
